//Notes: 9-15-2022
//Joined by a new member, Parker (added to Github and Discord)
//Assigned Scrum Master (Laurel)
//Assigning Role Specifications, subject to change:
//William - Neural Network Creation
//Rose Ellen - Documentation
//Laurel - Scrum Master and Research
//Parker - Hardware (Jetson and Drone)
//Chris - Image Processing Testing

//Spoke with Alejandro about the specific Jetson being used
//Standup meeting was very brief - covered that we've added the vision statement to the Github 
//and have created and assigned new issues for this Sprint. Those are now in-progress.

//We worked on assigning issues in the GitHub (had some difficulties)
//Discussing engineering notebooks, and talking about problems we may run into
//We also set the scrum master and assigned differing responsibilities (see above).

//The next steps to focus on are getting and reviewing more information aboout the Jetson and data set,
//meeting at the flight test to review current functionality and gather data,
//and beginning documentation for next deliverables
//as well as start working with Python to try out some first-trial neural networks
//So we left with plans to focus on those, and to meet at 1pm on Sunday, Sep 18th over Discord.
