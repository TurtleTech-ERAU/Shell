## Vision Statement
Our vision is to help improve the TurtleTech UAV capabilities by adding a neural network. TurtleTech is an unmanned aircraft created by Northrop Grumman and partnered with the Brevard Zoo to help conserve and educate the world on Florida's turtle population. The UAV uses a neural networking system to process and capture pictures of turtles from an aerial view. As the Embry Riddle TurtleTech team, our goal is to produce a functioning neural network system on a Nvidia Jetson device that identifies aerial turtle images against non-turtle images in real-time. By doing this, we hope to improve the current neural network system by bringing new ideas to the project and enhancing the UAV's real-time data capturing speed.
